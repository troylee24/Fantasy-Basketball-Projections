# Fantasy-Basketball-Projections

Fantasy basketball draft team builder. Projections data scraped from [Hashtag Basketball Projections](https://hashtagbasketball.com/fantasy-basketball-projections).

## Purpose

Hashtag Basketball provides a great resource for fantasy basketball projections. The only thing it's missing is a "team builder" function where someone can choose players in order to check their stats side-by-side (or row-by-row in this case).

This web app has a toggleable view between a table of projections for the NBA 2021-22 season and a table that displays players a user has "picked". A great usage of this app would be for adding players to their table as they are drafting in their actual league.
